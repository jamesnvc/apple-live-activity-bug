Demonstration of Apple bug with LiveActivity not updating.

Steps to reproduce the bug:

 - Run the project
 - Opening the app, see the "Current Value: #" counter count up (once every two seconds)
 - While the app is foregrounded, pulling down from the top-left corner to see the home screen shows the live activity widget, updating as expected
 - lock the phone or leave the app
 - looking at the live widget now, it no longer updates
 - when opening the app back up, see that the displayed value has continued to increase in the meantime
